* Emacs Config

This contains +two+ three directories, which are my general use-case =.doom.d= profile and another profile for dev-related work =.dev.d=, and a new vanilla emacs config inside of =.emacs.d=.

Currently I'm using a personal [[./.emacs.d/dracula-theme.el][theme]] based off of dracula that now looks nothing like it.

I'm also working on a new project, it allows for parsing testcases for competitive-programming contests leveraging the =competitive-companion= browser extension, you can look at the same in [[/.emacs.d/foxy.el][foxy.el]]. It's very much a work in progress and is inspired by the sublime text extension.

At the moment, doom's profile system isn't working for me so I just have the plain vanilla installation on my device.
#+end_quote

Doom allows for easy switching between profiles by creating new profiles in =~/.emacs.d/profiles.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Profile name : dev
;; Profile's doomdir : ~/.dev.d/
((dev (env ("DOOMDIR" . "~/.dev.d"))))
#+end_src

The data for this profile is stored in =~/.emacs.d/profiles/= directory. To switch to a profile, first create its config files and then run =doom --profile dev sync= and whenever you wish to run emacs with that profile, just do =emacs --profile dev=.
