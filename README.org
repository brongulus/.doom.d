#+title: Readme

This contains two directories, which are my general use-case =.doom.d= profile and another profile for dev-related work =.dev.d=.

Doom allows for easy switching between profiles by creating new profiles in =~/.emacs.d/profiles.el=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Profile name : dev
;; Profile's doomdir : ~/.dev.d/
((dev (env ("DOOMDIR" . "~/.dev.d"))))
#+end_src

The data for this profile is stored in =~/.emacs.d/profiles/= directory. To switch to a profile, first create its config files and then run =doom --profile dev sync= and whenever you wish to run emacs with that profile, just do =emacs --profile dev=.
